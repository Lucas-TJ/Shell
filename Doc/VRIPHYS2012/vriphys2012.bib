  abstract = {We introduce a new approach to mesh an animated implicit surface for
	rendering. Our contribution is a method which solves stability issues
	of implicit triangulation, in the scope of real-time rendering. This
	method is robust, moreover it provides interactive and quality rendering
	of animated or manipulated implicit surfaces.
	
	
	This approach is based on a double triangulation of the surface, a
	mechanical one and a geometric one. In the first triangulation, the
	vertices are the nodes of a simplified mechanical finite element
	model. The aim of this model is to uniformly and dynamically sample
	the surface. It is robust, efficient and prevents the inversion of
	triangles. The second triangulation is dynamically created from the
	first one at each frame. It is used for rendering and provides details
	in regions of high curvature. We demonstrate this technique with
	skeleton-based and volumetric animated surfaces.},

  abstract = {Recent mechanical models for cloth simulation have evolved toward
	accurate representation of elastic stiffness based on continuum mechanics,
	converging to formulations that are largely analogous to fast finite
	element methods. In the context of tensile deformations, these formulations
	usually involve the linearization of tensors, so as to express linear
	elasticity in a simple way. However, this approach needs significant
	adaptations and approximations for dealing with the nonlinearities
	resulting from large cloth deformations. Toward our objective of
	accurately simulating the nonlinear properties of cloth, we show
	that this linearization can indeed be avoided and replaced by adapted
	strain-stress laws that precisely describe the nonlinear behavior
	of the material. This leads to highly streamlined computations that
	are particularly efficient for simulating the nonlinear anisotropic
	tensile elasticity of highly deformable surfaces. We demonstrate
	the efficiency of this method with examples related to accurate garment
	simulation from experimental tensile curves measured on actual materials.},
