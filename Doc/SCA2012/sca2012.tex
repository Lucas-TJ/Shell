\section{Introduction}

Long captions should be set as in Figure~\ref{fig:ex1}.

\begin{figure}[htb]
   % an empty figure just consisting of the caption lines
   \caption{\label{fig:ex1}
     'Empty' figure only to serve as an example of long caption requiring 
     more than one line. It is not typed centered but aligned on both sides.}
\end{figure}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{References}

All graphics should be centered.

%  % replacing the above command with the one below will explicitly set
%  % the bounding box of the PS figure to the rectangle (xl,yl),(xh,yh).
%  % It will also prevent LaTeX from reading the PS file to determine
%  % the bounding box (i.e., it will speed up the compilation process)

%If your paper includes images, it is very important that they are of
%sufficient resolution to be faithfully reproduced.
%
%To determine the optimum size (width and height) of an image, measure
%the image's size as it appears in your document (in millimeters), and
%then multiply those two values by 12. The resulting values are the
%optimum $x$ and $y$ resolution, in pixels, of the image. Image quality
%will suffer if these guidelines are not followed.
%
%Example 1: 
%%
%An image measures 50\,mm by 75\,mm when placed in a document. This
%image should have a resolution of no less than 600 pixels by 900
%pixels in order to be reproduced faithfully.

%when you submit your finished paper. We MUST have this form before
%your paper can be published in the proceedings.
