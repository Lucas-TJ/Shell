  abstract = {This paper proposes a method for performing predictive simulation
	of cardiac surgery. It applies a hybrid approach to model the deformation
	of blood vessels. The hybrid blood vessel model consists of a reference
	Cosserat rod and a surface mesh. The reference Cosserat rod models
	the blood vessel’s global bending, stretching, twisting and shearing
	in a physically correct manner, and the surface mesh models the surface
	details of the blood vessel. In this way, the deformation of blood
	vessels can be computed efficiently and accurately. Our predictive
	simulation system can produce complex surgical results given a small
	amount of user inputs. It allows the surgeon to easily explore various
	surgical options and evaluate them. Tests of the system using bidirectional
	Glenn shunt (BDG) as an application example show that the results
	produced by the system are similar to real surgical results.},
