\begin{abstract}
This work provides a complete physical model for the deformations of the liver with its three constituents: parenchyma, vessels and the Glisson's capsule.
Some recent experimental results \cite{Ahn2010} have shown that there is a significant difference of stiffness between the Glisson's capsule and the parenchyma. 
Moreover, it has been observed that the capsule plays an important role for the deformation at the local level \cite{Hollenstein2006}.
However, the Glisson's capsule is very thin and its influence for the global deformations of the liver was never highlighted.
In this work, we propose to use a membrane FEM model for the capsule, that is coupled with a vascularized model of the liver.
We show that the approach is able to reproduce the deformations observed at the local level.
Additionally, we show, by simulating natural global deformations of the liver observed on real images (due to gravity), that the results have important differences with and without the capsule.

TODO

% -- TODO why model liver? what's interesting about it?
% -- liver covered by capsule, thin membrane


the usual approach is to model the organ as homogeneous material,
as such complex non-linear material descriptions are inevitably necessary
to describe the properties of non-homogeneous tissue.

modeling non-homogenous volumetric object by a dense mesh is complicated by
large number of elements. we propose a composite model and show that it
leads to adequate results.


The Glisson's capsule has in order of three higher
stiffness than the parenchyma. As such it plays an important role in the
deformation of the liver \cite{Ahn2010,Hollenstein2006}. Evaluation of the
liver as a homogeneous material can lead to overestimation of the
mechanical properties up to the factor of 3 \cite{Hollenstein2006}.

% -- TODO: properties of the capsule

We propose to further extend the tetrahedral based model of the parenchyma
with vascularized model \cite{Peterlik2012} by the layer of membrane elements.
(Modeling the capsule with tetrahedral elements is unfeasible -- many
elements or largely deformed elements.)

Based on the small thickness it seems reasonable to assume that no bending
strains limmit the deformation of the capsule. Therefore modeling the
capsule with membrane element only should be adequate.

GOAL: show that we are able to simulate the behaviour of non-homogeneous
tissue covered by capsule (liver/kidney) by combined model.

GOAL2: show that combination of linear tetrahedra and linear membrane is
easy.

% -----

The liver is usually modeled as a homogeneous isotropic (visco-)elastic
material \TG{need refs.?}. It is however non-homogeneous and modeling it as
such necessarily requires complex non-linear material formulation. Peterlik
et al. \cite{Peterlik2012} showed the importance of the vascular structures
on the liver deformation.

Another overlooked component is the Glisson's capsule. Despite it's very
small thickness it has high elastic modulus that is in three orders of
magnitude larger than that of the parenchyma. As such it plays an important
role in both global and local deformations of the liver.

It is not possible to model such thin structure with classical tetrahedral
elements.


% -----


% NOTE: the assumption is that we cannot estimate elastic modulus as a
% combination of the two moduli (for parenchyma and capsule) because it will
% work only for certain displacement. Is this valid?
% -- based on the text of Hollenstein2006 it seems like it


\section{Model}

\subsection{Parenchyma} %{{{

It is known that the parenchyma exhibits viscoealstic behaviour \TG{Cite
something}, we however employ simpler elastic model as we are not so much
interested in time-dependent behaviour but rather in static equilibrium
under certain conditions.
%
The parenchyma is modeled using corotational finite elmets. The corotational
formulation allows us to deal with geometrical non-linearities but still
rely on linear stress-strain relationship. Thus rotations and large
deformations are possible. In the corotational formulation the deformation
of each element is expressed in the local frame of reference. There are
several ways of computing the corotational frame for elements, we rely on
the geometrical method proposed in \cite{Nesme2005}.
% NOTE: This description of corotational method is very simplified and could be extended.
The stiffness matrix $\Mat{K}$ can be expressed in terms of the deformation
$u$ and the force as $\Vec{f} = \Mat{K}(\Vec{u}) \Vec{u}$. The resulting
system of linear equations is then solved by direct LDL solver.

%}}}

\subsection{Capsule} %{{{

The thickness of the Glisson's capsule is relatively small (Umale et al.
\cite{Umale2011} reported for porcine liver values in range of 10-20
$\mu$m). This makes it very difficult to model with volumetric mesh. Such
mesh would inevitably contain large number of elements or very irregular
elements. Instead modeling the capsule with two-dimensional elements seems
as a natural choice. Mechanics provides a FE tool in the form of membranes
and shells. Based on the small thickness (compared to the area) we also
assume negligible bending forces and propose a model based on membrane
elements. 

To maintain simplicity of the composite model we choos simple triangular
elements with constant strain.

\TG{add a ref. or dive into the definition?}

We again use linear elastic model and employ the  corotational formulation
for the triangular elements.



%}}}

\subsection{Coupling Between Capsule and Parenchyma} %{{{

High cohesion between capsule and parenchyma was reported. Based on this
property we may assume no relative motion of the capsule to the parenchyma.

While in general we could use arbitrary surface mesh for a capsule we use
the fact that the parenchyma is modeled by tetrahedral elements which have
triangular faces. Because the boundary of the volumetric mesh is already
triangulated, we only extract the boundary triangles which we use for the
model of capsule.

Using directly the boundary of the tetrahedral mesh does not only solve the
problem of obtaining the triangular mesh, but has one more advantage. Nodes
of the triangular mesh overlap with nodes of the tetrahedral mesh and we do
not have to project nodes of tiangular mesh onto the tetrahedra. More over,
the stiffness matrices for capsule and parenchyma are easily assembled
together and solved as one system.

\TG{Is assembling process too obvious?}

Withouth the loss of generality we can assume the tetrahedron consists of
nodes $p_1, p_2, p_3$ and $p_4$, the boundary triangle has nodes $p_1, p_2$
and $p_3$. We can reorder the degrees of freedom so that the stiffness
matrix $\Mat{K}^t$ for the tetrahedron can be written as:

\begin{equation}
  \Mat{K}^t = \left[\begin{array}{c|c}
      \Mat{K}^t_{1-3,1-3} & \Mat{K}^t_{1-3,4} \\
      \hline
      \Mat{K}^t_{4,1-3} & \Mat{K}^t_{4,4} \\
  \end{array}\right]
\end{equation}

Then the assembled stiffness matrix for the element is:

\begin{equation}
  \Mat{K} = \left[\begin{array}{c|c}
      \Mat{K}^t_{1-3,1-3} & \Mat{K}^t_{1-3,4} \\
      \hline
      \Mat{K}^t_{4,1-3} & \Mat{K}^t_{4,4} \\
  \end{array}\right]
  +
  \left[\begin{array}{c|c}
      \Mat{K}^m & 0 \\
      \hline
      0 & 0 \\
  \end{array}\right]
\end{equation}

Where $\Mat{K}^m$ is the stiffness matrix of the triangular membrane.

%}}}

\subsection{Blood Vessels} %{{{

We also combined our composite model with vascularization method proposed
by Peterlik et al. \cite{Peterlik2012}. The method is based on linear beams
with local frames of reference (in a many aspects similar to the
corotational formulation). As such the model also handles geometric
non-linearities in the deformation. The proposed model assumes no relative
motion of vessels to the parenchyma. Segmented vascular network is
discretized into the set of linear elements that are then projected into
the tetrahedral mesh of the parenchyma. During the simulation forces and
torques resulting from the deformations of vessels by parenchyma are
computed and propagated back onto the tetrahedral mesh.

%}}}


\section{Experiments} %{{{

To evaluate the model we have implemented in the
SOFA\footnote{www.sofa-framework.org} framework and performed a set of
numerical simulations. We have tests the influence of the capsule for both
local and global deformations. In the simulations material properties for a
porcine liver were used as reported by Umale \cite{Umale2013}. The
parenchyma was modeled with elastic modulus 1980~Pa and the capsule has
elastic modulus 8~MPa and thickness 20~$\mu$m.
\TG{The vessels have same parameters as Igor used in his work. Is this OK
or should we use values reported by Sagar for consistency?}

\subsection{Local deformations}

Hollenstain et al. \cite{Hollenstein2006} measured the response of the
bovine liver to the negative pressure using their aspiration test. One of
the observations was that the Glissons capsule has non-negligible influence
and modeling only the parenchyma leads to overestimation of the
deformation. We reproduced the test with our model and acquired similar
results.

The aspiration device consists of a tube with 1 cm in diameter and is able
to control internal pressure in the tube. The test is performed by
attaching the tube to the tissue and meassuring the tissue response. We
have set up a simulation in the spirit of this test. 
% TODO: fix the scene! tube has 5 mm radius, not 1 cm
The simulation is performed with a 3x3x3 cm cube of liver tissue and tube
with 1 cm radius. The pressure of 2 kPa is simulated inside the tube.

Figure \ref{fig-aspiration} shows the profiles of cuts in the middle of the
cube for the model with and without capsule. It can be seen that the
deformation for the model without capsule is much larger which is in
aggreement with the data obtained by Hollenstain et al.

\Figure{4in}{aspiration}{TODO: aspiration test; fix figure, add screenshot}

\subsection{Global Deformations}

Test 1) Global deformation of liver under gravity
  * show that there is a difference between simple homogeneous material
    and material with capsule
  * include blood vessels

  et al.
