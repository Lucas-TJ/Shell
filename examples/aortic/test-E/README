Scenes to measure the effecto of Young's modulus (E) on the simulation

=== Meshes ===
cylinder1.obj   two cylinders, each with radius 1 and height 2; distance
                between cylinders is 0.6; 128 elements 
cylinder2.obj   same as cylinder1.obj except it has 512 elements

=== Scenes and Results ===

cyl1            Old shells, nu=0.33, t=0.01, uses cylinder1.obj
                Max Hausdorff distance < 0.1e-4%

cyl2            Old shells, nu=0.33, t=0.01, uses cylinder2.obj
                !!! DOESN'T WORK !!!
                (works with t=0.1)

cyl2-bez        Bezier shells nu=0.33, t=0.01, uses cylinder2.obj
                Max. deflection is 0.066268 (for E=1e7)
                Max. Haussdorf distance is 0.000982 (between all results)
                that is: ~1.5% of the deflection
                         ~0.1% of the radius

example06       Old shells
                !!! PROBLEM with large contactStiffnes that is necessary for
                !!! large Young's modulus
                (maybe there's a way to fix that?)
