We introduced a new approach for predictive simulation of CHD corrective surgeries. It is based on thin shell elements and a relaxation method for joining blood vessels and patches by topologically connecting affected shell elements. Low-level surgical procedures can be performed universally using this method. We showed that we only need a small number of thin shell elements to achieve predictive simulation results. A sophisticated remeshing algorithm is needed to allow for arbitrary incisions.
